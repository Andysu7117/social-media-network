# social-media-network

## Description

This application is a backend for a social media app. This app creates, updates and adds users and their thoughts. The technologies used for this application were:

- node.js
- mongoose
- nodemon
- mongodb

The biggest challenge that came up during this project was getting the add and delete reaction routes to work and using monogoose correctly to make them work.

## Installation

To install this project you will just have to download the repository of this project to your computer. Once downloaded you will have to cd into the repository. Once in the repository you will have to do an 'npm install' in the terminal to install all the dependencies listed in the package.json. You will only be able to 'npm install' if you have node.js installed, if not installed in can be found [here](https://nodejs.org/en). You will also have to install mongodb if it isn't already installed, which can be found [here](https://www.mongodb.com/)

## Usage

Once everything has been installed you can use this application by running 'npm run seed' to seed the data in and then 'npm start' to start the application. Once the application has been start you can test the api routes by using and API development platform. The platform the I used was insomnia and a demo of how all the api routes are used can be found using the following link: https://youtu.be/Q3tYwDAz3vo
